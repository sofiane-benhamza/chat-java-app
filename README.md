this is a README file to help you understand more this application.
NOTE : Threads and Sockets were used in this project.
<br><br>
to run it in your computer, make sure you already have JDK installed in your machine
<br><br>
open TERMINAL or CMD in the directory where you cloned those java files, compile them with :
<br><br>
<div><code> javac * </code></div>
<br><br>
then launch the server class with : 
<br><br>
<div><code> java Server </code></div>
<br><br>
and start launching as much clients as you want with the commande :
<br><br>
<div><code> java User </code></div>
<br><br>
NOTES : 
you must launch the Server  class firstly because its TCP, if not, the app won't work properly.
make sure the ports are not in already use by any process.
